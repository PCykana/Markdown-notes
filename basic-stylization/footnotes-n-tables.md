Footnotes are a special version of markdown GitHub has built for it's users

in a line of text[^1] you add a number next to a carat inside brackets[^2] creating superscript footnote markers[^3]

[^1] you then repeat

[^2] those brackets somewhere below

[^3] and GitHub will shunt them to the bottom

| GitHub | has added | Tables |
| -----  | :----: | ------: |
| Dashes for hard lines | An amount greater than 1 | is all you need |
| Default is | Colon surrounding dashes  | Colon on right end |
| left | centers the column | right justifies |
| justified | and | the column |


vscode will not add the footnotes properly (unless maybe you have an extension?)
