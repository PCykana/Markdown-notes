#task lists 

-this only works in git

Task list
-[x] First
   -[x] one
   -[ ] 2
-[ ] second

but basic idea is boxes made by brackets with an X for completed and a space between for incomplete, followed by the textdescription of the task.

collapsed details do work in vs code tho.

<details>
Can i put stuff above the summary?-yes.
<summary>create shortname between summary tags. Can be detials or whatever.</summary>

This is basically HTML.
1. Create a details HTML tag. open and close
2. Create summary within it's tags.
   - can be anywhere within details tag
3. Within the details tags put the text you want to be able to collapse

</details>
